[Read in portuguese :brazil:](https://gitlab.com/Ferreira.will/wiki-and-morty)

## Introduction

This is a simple Android app that uses a [free Rick and Morty api](https://rickandmortyapi.com/) to show some information from the animation

The main objective of this project is to be a portifolio project where I use tools like:
* Android development using Kotlin
* Retrofit
* Room
* MVVM
* TDD
* Automated unit tests Using GitLab CI
